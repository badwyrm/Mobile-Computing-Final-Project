# Mobile-Computing-Final-Project

Andrew Tran

My idea is similiar to the the "I don't care" app we discussed in class. I'm thinking Tinder but for food. 
Local Resturants go on the app and post pictures of their best/most popular dishes and display them as kind of a front, 
kind of like a profile for their resturant. Users look at the food and swipe left or right and users can see 
what the dish is and what the resturant is. When users match up, they can receieve discounts or make reservations 
straight from the app.

Tinder style card animation logic mostly provided by the facebook pop animation library

https://github.com/facebook/pop
Pop is an extensible animation engine for iOS, tvOS, and OS X. In addition to basic static animations, it supports spring and decay dynamic animations, making it useful for building realistic, physics-based interactions. The API allows quick integration with existing Objective-C or Swift codebases and enables the animation of any property on any object. It's a mature and well-tested framework that drives all the animations and transitions in Paper.
