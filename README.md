# Mobile-Computing-Final-Project

My idea is similiar to the the "I don't care" app we discussed in class. I'm thinking Tinder but for food. 
Local Resturants go on the app and post pictures of their best/most popular dishes and display them as kind of a front, 
kind of like a profile for their resturant. Users look at the food and swipe left or right and users can see 
what the dish is and what the resturant is. When users match up, they can receieve discounts or make reservations 
straight from the app.
